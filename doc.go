/*
	package functional contains some simple helper routines to help avoid explicit loops, and provide concise conditionals.
	This package is experimental.  Not in the sense that it's unstable ... just in the sense that I'm not sure how useful it will be.
	(I found some of these functions useful once ... experience will tell if a pattern emerges there ...)
